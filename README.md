Make sure you have typescript and node installed
1. Run npm i
2. Update the addresses to the correct addresses for program ids, idls, farm id, wallet and which network you're using
3. Run npx tsc script.ts --resolveJsonModule --esModuleInterop (for some reason I had to manually add the flags)
4. run node script.ts
